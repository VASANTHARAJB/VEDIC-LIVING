              A group of Vedic academics who have completed Prayoga and Veda
              adhyayanam, along with the Sree Jnanambika Research Foundation for
              Vedic Living, launched Vedicliving.in. We hope to educate people
              worldwide about our magnificent Dharma by means of www.vedicliving.in.

              knowledge is meaningless without the practical application of the

          today—financial, health, divorce, and psychological—are brought on by a
          lack of Nithyakarmanushtana, or daily prescribed rituals and duties, as
          well as by incorrectly performing the Shodasha Samakaras (16 required
          rites in Shastras) and Shanthis. All of the aforementioned problems can
          be resolved by correctly adhering to the Vedic Prayogas and Anushtanas.
          It is better to do Pariharas based on Sasthras that is for which there
          is Sasthra Pramana (which we suggest in the site and follow) and keep
          Indian astrological system as a support for that rather than directly
          depending on the astrology. We keep Indian astrology as a support
          system for the Sasthra wherever it is required

              Online Classes are a combination of video recordings and live
              lectures with course reading and tests. They are generally conducted
              using a virtual portal through which students gather reading
              materials, interact with teachers and classmates, view grades, and
              monitor progress. Online classes have become a part of the new
              normal and have become an integral part of our lives. Education is a
              dynamic field that experiences great innovations with every passing
              day. Digital transformations and the arrival of novel technologies
              in the Ed-tech sector have acted as a great catalyst collectively
              because the student outcomes have witnessed tremendous growth.
              Ed-tech is simplifying things both for the teachers and the
              students. For instance, consider the example of a <a href="#" class="text-link">classroom app</a>.
              It has emerged as a highly popular way of imparting education.
              Similarly, the use of technology is going to enrich the academic
              development of the students by providing education with the
              much-needed digital infrastructure. Greater student-teacher
              interaction and collaboration is ensured by the application of
              online classes in day-to-day education.

              All sufferings are because of sins or papa we do in the past birth
              and present birth says sasthra. Veda manthra only has got the power to
              remove the papa which veda itself is saying. Hence we do veda
              parihara to destroy the papa by which we can get relived from
              sufferings. Even many diseases which are not completely curable
              with modern medicine (Eg;Diabatiese, BP) are actually due to poorva
              janma papa only, says sasthra."Poorva janma kritham papam
              vyadiroopena bhadhadhey". To fulfill our wishes and remove the
              obstacles in our daily life and profession, we can do different
              poojas, homams, parayanams which will definitely help us to attain
              our goals by removing the negatives in us, making us more energetic
              and focused and also will get Devatha anugraham which is required to
              attain the success in all endeavors.

              Rishees through their brain power attained through thapas, have realised the vedas present
              as Sabda Rasees (Sound Group) in the atmosphere, they have realised
              it and transferred it into their minds, chanted it and also taught
              to next generations. We call them Manthra Drushta or who has realised
              the manthras
            </p>
            <p>
              Devatha is actually the Manthra swaroopa. The
              letters represents the physical bodily structure of Devatha and we can
              bring the Devatha presence in water, fire and in Brahmin, says
              sasthra. Hence in all Vaideeka Karmas the combination of Water, Fire
              and Feeding of Brahmins -that is Kumbha Sthapana, Agin that is Homam
              and Brahmana Poojanam/Bhojana will be their.

              Astrology is a range of <a href="#" class="text-link">divinatory</a> practices, recognized as 
              <a href="#" class="text-link">pseudoscientific</a> since the 18th century,<a href="#" class="text-link">[1]</a><a href="#" class="text-link">[2]</a>
              that propose that information about human affairs and terrestrial
              events may be discerned by studying the apparent positions of <a href="#" class="text-link">celestial objects</a>.
              Different cultures have employed forms of astrology since at least
              the 2nd millennium BCE, these practices having originated in <a href="#" class="text-link">calendrical</a>
              systems used to predict seasonal shifts and to interpret celestial
              cycles as signs of divine communications.
            </p>
            <p>
              Most, if not all, cultures have attached importance to what they observed in the sky,
              and some—such as the <a href="#" class="text-link">Hindus</a>, <a href="#" class="text-link">Chinese</a>, and the <a href="#" class="text-link">Maya</a>
              —developed elaborate systems for predicting terrestrial events from
              celestial observations. <a href="#" class="text-link">Western astrology</a>, one of the oldest astrological systems still in use, can trace
              its roots to 19th–17th century BCE <a href="#" class="text-link">Mesopotamia</a>, from where it spread to Ancient Greece, Rome, the 
              <a href="#" class="text-link">Islamic world</a>, and eventually Central and Western Europe. Contemporary Western
              astrology is often associated with systems of <a href="#" class="text-link">horoscopes</a>
              that purport to explain aspects of a person's personality and
              predict significant events in their lives based on the positions of
              celestial objects; the majority of professional astrologers rely on
              such systems.
